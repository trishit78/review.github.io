      I can't remember when I first saw Tom Cruise, but it was probably on my
      computer. I'm not sure whose movie it was, but it was definitely a
      torrent. I grew to love him over time because of the life-or-death stunts
      he does for us on TV. He is, as far as I'm aware that he is the last great
      movie star to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cruise’s reputation has ranged over the years from hero to villain to
      general curiosity. At nearly 60, one might imagine he’s done. But here he
      is, proving everyone wrong, at the helm of a $170m action movie that broke
      US box office records on its opening weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1986 original of Top Gun was cleverly capitalised on by the sequel's
      creators, who updated the fighter jets and crew while liberally infusing
      nods to the first film into every aspect of the sequel. It's been more
      than 35 years since the release of the original Top Gun, in which Tom
      Cruise employed his widest grin as a US Navy aviator with a point to prove
      and a childlike delight in playing with high-speed toys (which just happen
      to be built for killing people, but whatever).
    </p>

    <p>
      Now talking about this film, Tom returns to the cockpit as Pete "Maverick"
      Mitchell, still feeling the need for speed no matter what the top brass
      says. And now, enough time has passed since his co-pilot Goose's death in
      the original film for Goose's son to be a fully grown man, who is
      portrayed by Miles Teller, is a flying Rooster with the Navy and is a chip
      off the old block.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening credits describe Maverick, like the original. The opening text
      caption explaining the concept of the US Navy's Fighter Weapons School
      uses the same wording as the first film. And throughout, director Joseph
      Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda faithfully re-create the late
      Tony Scott's cinematic style.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flight deck sequence has zero connection to what comes after, but it's
      still a pretty great introduction, instantly immersing you in the familiar
      feel of a film you may have seen many times or may not have seen for
      years. More importantly, it feels real, the film setting out its stall
      from the very beginning: It's about real stuff, like fighter planes and
      sailboats and proper old-fashioned stunts, not fake stuff like drones and
      phones and computer-generated spectacle. Top Gun: Maverick uses the visual
      language of the original, the camera jammed claustrophobically into a
      cockpit or shaking as it struggles to keep up with a jet screaming past.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's no disguising that a lot of the story is a rerun of the original.
      For example, Cruise takes the Kelly McGillis role, just for fun. But
      somehow, despite the fact it's all geared toward a life-or-death mission,
      the stakes don't feel as immediate as they did the first time around. The
      original film was fuelled by the sense Maverick was genuinely dangerous to
      the people around him, but this new model doesn't capture the same
      headlong rush into the danger zone. Partly because the younger models look
      more like, well, models, rather than warriors. But the main problem is
      that the mission is so improbably specific to the needs of the plot. The
      G-force of narrative silliness will start to crush your brain, especially
      when a late-stage twist fires the afterburners and jets into absurdity
      that might tempt you to eject.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can get all of this all of that regret in the relationship Maverick
      has with Penny Benjamin, and how this is the way he wants it to be. He's
      going to make up for it. But remember, the real love story has always been
      between Maverick and Iceman. And that's where the beating heart of the
      film strikes the strongest Val Kilmer’s battle with cancer, which he's
      managed to win thankfully, a year since the movie was filmed is integrated
      into the story, which is one of the most tasteful uses of an actor who is
      transformed so significantly since the last time we saw them in this
      property. Iceman only gets one scene in the movie, and it's heart-breaking
      because of the unavoidable real-life parallels, but it's also powerful,
      Maverick comes to Iceman not knowing what to do with the rooster and his
      assignment and Iceman, who can barely speak and largely communicates
      through typing now do not waste time or mince words. He's jovial towards
      his run, but also blunt. Maverick isn't struggling with a rooster he's
      struggling with a goose. He's struggling with his past demons, that he had
      to let go of. Maverick has to let Rooster be his own man. But the reality
      is that Maverick has been holding on to the goose since he was cradling
      his body in the water. He let go physically, but he hasn't let go. It's
      holding him back from giving his students what they need from giving
      Rooster what he needs, inside and outside of the cockpit and from giving
      himself what he needs. Iceman drills this into Maverick's head and doesn't
      give him an inch to shy away from the lesson that he needs to learn from
      the fact that even the world's best pilot doesn't know everything. This is
      an incredible scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top Gun: Maverick, meanwhile, doesn't even tell us who Tom's fighting
      against. There's an unnamed faceless adversary, black-helmeted bogeys and
      boogeymen, stripped of sovereignty or even humanity. The eternal enemy,
      somewhere out there, doing vaguely defined bad-sounding things that need
      to be blown up by missiles and helicopters and aircraft carriers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who cares about that? This isn't Saving Private Ryan, this is Top Gun.
      Anyone who loves a great popcorn action movie that's as enjoyable as it is
      ridiculous. Top Gun: Maverick is a blast. The film keeps insisting this is
      Maverick's last post, but this polished action movie powerhouse is a fun
      way to fly into the sunset.
